For a response variable that is influenced by a predictor variable, the formula would be:\nY \\sim X\nwhich corresponds to the statement\n\nThe response Y is predicted by X\n\nresponse \\sim predictor\n\n\nPlotting\n\nIn the Analysis tab, click on the Flexplot option.\nSelect the response variable and drag it to the ‘Outcome variable’ box.\nSelect the predictor variable and drag it to the ‘Predictor variable’ box.\nTinker with the plot options to customise the behaviour of the plot.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nSingle continuous Y\nThis produces a histogram or a boxplot.\n\nVideoHistogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Y, continuous X\nThis produces a scatterplot. You should explore the options for a fitted line, confidence bands, and jittering.\n\nVideoScatter plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Y, categorical X\nThis produces various plots, such as the boxplot and the violin plot. The categorical variable X is used to group the data.\n\nVideoBoxplotViolin plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Y, multiple X\nIf you add multiple X variables, you can explore more ways to visualise the relationships between them. Use panelling to create separate plots for each combination of X variables.\n\nVideoMixed plotFaceted plot\n\n\nNote: The video explores some of the options available for mixed plots and has no specific focus on a single plot type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution\nThis cheatsheet was developed using resources that are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license and made available on the SOLES Open Educational Resources repository."
