## About
This cheatsheet provides a quick reference for using the `flexplot` module in Jamovi to create plots by specifying a formula. Depending on the variable types and the specified formula, `flexplot` can automatically generate a variety of plot types, including scatter plots and box plots.

#### Assumed knowledge

- Jamovi is installed and ready to use. This cheatsheet uses Jamovi 2.7.4.0.
- A basic understanding of statistical concepts and terminology, such as the difference between categorical and continuous variables.
- A basic knowledge of how to create model formulae, e.g., $y \sim x$.


## Data

We will use the well-known penguins dataset from the `palmerpenguins` R package. The dataset has been exported from the package in a format that Jamovi can read (.csv).

## Install the `flexplot` module

If you have not already installed the `flexplot` module, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Open the **Modules** tab in Jamovi.
2. Click on **Jamovi Library**.
3. Search for `flexplot` and click **Install**.

## Import data

1. Click the <i class="bi bi-list" aria-hidden="true"></i> **hamburger menu** at the top-left of the Jamovi window.
2. Select **Open** to open the file dialogue.
3. In the dialogue, navigate to the folder where you saved `penguins.csv` and click **Open**.

## Plot

### Recalling formulae syntax

In most cases, general linear models can be described using a standardised formula syntax. For a response variable that is influenced by a predictor variable, the formula would be:

$$Y \sim X$$

which corresponds to the statement

> The response $Y$ is predicted by $X$

$$response \sim predictor$$


### Plotting

1. In the **Analysis** tab, click on the **Flexplot** option.
2. Select the **response variable** and drag it to the 'Outcome variable' box.
3. Select the **predictor variable** and drag it to the 'Predictor variable' box.
4. Tinker with the plot options to customise the behaviour of the plot.

### Examples

#### Single continuous $Y$
This produces a histogram or a boxplot.

#### Continuous $Y$, continuous $X$
This produces a **scatterplot**. You should explore the options for a fitted line, confidence bands, and jittering.

## Scatter plot

#### Continuous $Y$, categorical $X$

This produces various plots, such as the boxplot and the violin plot. The categorical variable $X$ is used to group the data.

#### Continuous $Y$, multiple $X$

If you add multiple $X$ variables, you can explore more ways to visualise the relationships between them. Use **panelling** to create separate plots for each combination of $X$ variables.

Note: The video explores some of the options available for mixed plots and has no specific focus on a single plot type.
